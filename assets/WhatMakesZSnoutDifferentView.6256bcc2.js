For example, Google Docs is dedicated to providing a good writing experience, Khan Academy aims to teach people different things, and YouTube is good at connecting people with videos they\u2019ll enjoy. On the other hand, zSnout has lots of different content, as you can tell from spending over three seconds on the homepage.

Most sites I\u2019ve seen either use a white theme with an accent color or have a seperate theme for when the user\u2019s in dark mode. On zSnout, we default you to using the dark theme and allow you to choose which theme you want. Additionally, our \u201Cdark\u201D theme is mostly aqua because it\u2019s my favorite color and I like to feature it prominently in things I make, whereas most websites use a strictly black theme for \u201Cdark mode\u201D.",-1),y=e("h2",{id:"it%E2%80%99s-an-app%3F",tabindex:"-1"},"It\u2019s An App?",-1),w=e("p",null,"To tell you the truth, I\u2019m surprised at how few websites make themselves offline-capable.
